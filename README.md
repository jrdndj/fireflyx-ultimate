# fireflyx-ultimate
Repository for FireFlyX Project 

We take inspiration from Otomushi (Andre, 2010) where they designed and fabricated Japanese insects that are interactable. Otomushi, derived from its Japanese meaning sound insect, is a platform for interacting with sound samples which is represented in insects. These creatures  enable the users to compose sound by touching and displaying visual cues within the movable parts of the insects. Based on learner studies, children interact and learn faster if they work with “animal agents” as compared to being guided by human and teacher agents. Otomushi was designed at a time where mobile applications and systems were not yet prevalent and or even seamless. We intend to explore whether the concept of Otomushi (translated as Firefly) can be ported into a mobile musical learning tool empowered by multi-gestures operating in a collaborative network that allows children to work on multiple groupware matrices of CSCW (Johansen 1988). 

Children are naturally -playful, curious and inquisitive but their cognitive states are the best times for learning complex things such as music and language. The study of music is something that is complex, well disciplined, and involves many theories to learn (Byrd 2009). Yet, music can be something that can be well-represented in a playful environment such as a sandbox environments - where children can learn freely, allowing them to interact with objects without the fear of “breaking things” somewhere in their stages of creativity (Goldberg et al 1996).

We  introduce FireFlyX (firefly experiences) - an environment that combines playfulness, natural creativity and the humility of insect creatures - to investigate, discover and explore how children can happily collaborate towards learning and composing music. 

This project will have three main phases
Phase 1: FireFlyX - development of the Firefly sandbox platform
Phase 2: XFirefly - deployment of Firefly as a multi-user collaborative platform
Phase 3: FireflyXUltimate - multisymphonic firefly platform
